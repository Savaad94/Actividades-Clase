    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Cinema is the technique of creating and projecting footage, although beyond its traditional definition, cinema has achieved the title of "seventh art" due to the way in which we can convey emotions, stories and how it has become the modern storyteller par excellence. Cinema, far from being just entertainment, is capable of telling visions from the most simplistic ones, made just for fun, to those deeper and more mature moments</p>
        <p>Cinema, as a means of expression and transmission of emotions, becomes one of the most powerful means to impose suspense and fear in its spectators.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>In this page we are going to focus on some important titles, as well as on actors and actresses who have a high importance in this already ancient medium of entertainment and art.</p>
        <p>In a wave of cheap horror movies, based on serial killers, ghosts or beings from another dimension, looking at the chosen films is more than a choice. It is an ode to suspense.</p>
        <h3>Film genres</h3>
        <p>In cinema, there are a series of film genres that serve to delimit certain ideas. To better understand what makes the films we are about to mention so important, it is necessary to comment on these genres:</p>
        <h4>Action:</h4>
        <p>The action genre in films is characterized by high-energy sequences, thrilling stunts, intense combat, and adrenaline-pumping moments that keep audiences engaged and on the edge of their seats.</p>
        <h4>Comemedy:</h4>
        <p>The comedy genre in films aims to entertain through humor, wit, and amusing situations, often using clever dialogue, funny scenarios, and comedic timing to evoke laughter and joy in audiences.</p>
        <h4>Horror:</h4>
        <p>The horror genre in films aims to elicit fear, suspense, and shock in audiences through unsettling atmospheres, suspenseful build-ups, and frightening imagery, often exploring themes of the supernatural, psychological terror, or the unknown to create a chilling and intense experience.</p>

        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <p>The films we are going to talk about will be two personal favorites, starting with a classic thriller. The famous adaptation of the novel by Thomas Harris: The Silence of the Lambs.</p>
        <video width="640" height="360" src="as_bestas_trailer.mp4" controls></video> 
        <p>Continuing with thrillers, the next film we will discuss is a gem of Spanish cinema released about a year ago: As Bestas.</p>    
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Directors</h2>
        <p>In the case of our first film, Silence of the Lambs was directed by the, until then not too well known, director Jonathan Demme, director, producer and screenwriter, also creator of works such as Philadelphia, or Ricki and the Flash.  </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://realityquotes.com/alfred-hitchcock-quotes/">
            <p>"Imagine a man sitting on the favorite sofa in his house. Below is a bomb ready to explode. He ignores it, but the public knows it. This is suspense."</p>
            <p><strong>Alfred Hitchcock</strong></p></blockquote>
        <p>On the other hand, in the case of our most recent homeland jewel, the Spaniard Rodrigo Sorogoyen was the author of the film As Bestas, after being awarded for the film "El Reino" (The Kingdom). Both of those directors were not very successful at the box office, and do not come close, not even by a little bit, to the highest grossing films of all time, which you can see below:  </p>

        <h2>Actors and Actresses</h2>
        <p>Demme's film has a cast that until then was not too well known, but today are eminent filmmakers. Some of them are better known, such as Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) or Jodie Foster (Inspector Clarice Starling), not to mention Ted Levine and his interpretation of Buffalo Bill, or Scott Glenn as the police chief Jack Crawford.</p>

            <em>"We begin by coveting what we see every day"</em>
        <p>On the other hand, we cannot leave behind the impressive performances of Sorogoyen's film, with a magnificent Luiz Zahera interpeting the shadowy Xan, as the French actress Marina Foïs, giving life to the worried wife of Denis Ménochet, who will give life to Antoine. Undoubtedly, another almost unknown but stellar cast.</p>
